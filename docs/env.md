# Environment Variables

The server currently has three environment variables it relies on to properly function:

- `EXPRESS_PORT` - recommended 3000
- `WSS_PORT` - recommended 8080
- `MONGODB_URL` - the URL to connect to the MongoDB server

## Starter .env file

```
EXPRESS_PORT=3000
WSS_PORT=8080
MONGODB_URL=mongodb://host:port/database_name
```
